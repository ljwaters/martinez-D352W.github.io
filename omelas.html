    <p> 	The short story by Ursula K. Leguin “The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas” proposes an intriguing dilemma: is the flawless utopia for an entire city worth the immeasurable sacrifice of a single child? The author never proposes just one singular idea for the nearly perfect city and allows the reader to create their own town of Omelas. It enables you to dive in and be a part of it all before you are torn down into the dungeon of the dream world where the poor child survives. Little information is offered about the child outside of their grueling lifestyle. It is as if all that is bad has been encumbered onto a single soul. “They all know it is there, all the people of Omelas. Some of them have come to see it, others are content merely to know it is there. They all know that it has to be there.” Once you discover the child, you have a choice to make. You either remain in ignorance or leave with the heavy guilt of the knowledge. This raises a few primary questions:
        <ul>
            <li>Are those who choose to continue living in the city selfish because of their decision?</li><br>
            <li>Do those who leave actually make a difference?</li><br>
            <li>If just walking away does no good and no change in the life of the child can be made, then is it wrong to reap the benefits of their burdens?</li><br>
        </ul>
        <strong>Happiness is not achievable without sacrifice, however, the sacrifice should not be burdened onto a single person; it would be inhumane to justify subjecting any human to this torture. </strong>
