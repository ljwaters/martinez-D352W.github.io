            <strong>The CS community has deep-rooted issues of elitism and dominance of white employees who create barriers to entry and increased difficulties for non-white communities.</strong><br>
            <br>
            “When will we have the collective conversation about SIGCSE that many of us have had for years now; especially those who are not white and/or do not have a Ph.D.?”<br>
            <br>
            The peer review process is flawed and tainted by prior, biased conceptions and a lack of proper knowledge/understanding.<br>
            <br>
            The elitism of education level creates exclusion of major perspectives in the community of educators.<br>
            <br>
            Refusal to educate oneself culturally in terms of class, race, and gender causes harm and exclusion to groups of people that further burden them with societal and ethical complications.<br>
            <br>
            There is a general lack of information on the processes of peer reviews for undergraduate students and general audiences.<br>
            <br>
            How can a larger conversation be started within the STEM community about biases to begin the process of a more inclusive field?<br>
            <br>
            Suppressed groups are held to a higher standard of work furthering discrimination and suppression.<br>
            <br>
            “In addition, the entire point of focusing on identity and identity-inclusive computing is that every individual (no matter their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, ability, and more) has a unique standpoint that allows them to enter classrooms as a situated knower and learner based on their identities as well as their positions within CS education (tenure and non-tenure track faculty, K-12 educators, and Ph.D. students).”<br>
            <br>
            Who is allowed to peer review, and what is their background typically?<br>
            <br>
            “In the documentary “Picture a Scientist,” Dr. Raychelle Burks notes the inordinate amount of time she wastes as a Black woman daily at work addressing a racist and/or misogynistic email/encounter. More important, she discusses how her white and Asian colleagues never have to do this.”<br>
