            The adaptability and relevancy of AI has opened the door for those in the neurodivergent community in terms of gaining an adequate education and accessing the professional world. Education is a major step towards equality, and a large barrier for neurodivergent individuals are those who misunderstand the capability of people in the community. The app InnerVoice is changing how children with communication challenges learn using AI. Their website claims,<blockquote cite= "https://medium.com/the-neuro/how-ai-is-improving-accessibility-510f6c70177c">“We believe that the current technology is ready but underutilized and that communication can be mastered if people are provided with the right tools.​ We make those tools.”</blockquote> They use Microsoft’s Azure AI for image recognition, and models of the children’s own faces then say it to them to be recited. This allows the children to gain instantaneous feedback and interactability. Numerous other features provide aid in filling the gap in education.<br>
            In terms of professions, new job training has become available that allows the best assets of neurodivergent people to be prioritized. It is shown that they excel in many skills that modern businesses are seeking. Accommodations are being made to try and make neurodivergent individuals more comfortable while working, such as quiet workspaces and AI briefings of paperwork. However, some concerns emerge when the article says:<blockquote cite="https://www.innervoiceapp.com/">“Companies also appreciate neurodivergent employees’ affinity for repetitive tasks, which can cause burnout in many neurotypical workers, and their loyalty to the company as they are less likely to leave for other opportunities.”</blockquote>
            <strong>Issues in ethicality may arise if someone who is neurodivergent has difficulties communicating boundaries with the provided tasks or recognizing if someone is taking advantage of them.</strong> This may normalize neurodivergent people as doers of monotonous work rather than leaders of their profession. Is it okay to employ neurodivergent individuals intending to use them for repetitive work? Despite this, it is still an improvement from prior difficulties in the job search. Now, there’s a new generation of neurodivergent students with a stronger education and a brighter professional future.
